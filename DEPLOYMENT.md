## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Build fails:**
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

**Deploy fails:**
- Check that all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Ensure `build` script works locally
- Check platform-specific logs

**App doesn't load:**
- Verify all static assets are included
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure routing is configured correctly

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the platform's documentation**
2. **Review build logs**
3. **Test locally first**
